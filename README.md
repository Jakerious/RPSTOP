# RPSTOP
Below is a project from the Odin Project curriculum. It is simply coding a game of rock, paper, scissors. 

From this project, I hope to learn more about JS and how I can use it to create complex code and better webpages in the future. I want to focus
on making clean and consise code that functions but is also readable. Keeping comments should be a goal of mine as well.
